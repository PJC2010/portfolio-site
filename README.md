# Portfolio-site
A simple portfolio website I created. 
The site is divided into three sections: bio, portfolio, and contact. 
The bio is simply a small description of myself and my interests as a web developer. The portolio section which will contain all of my current work (or lack thereof at the moment) and some contact information where prospective employers or client can reach me. 
This portfolio is a work in progress and will add much more as I progess in my web development career.
